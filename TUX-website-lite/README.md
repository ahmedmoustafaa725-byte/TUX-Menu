# TUX Static Website — Lite (Images only)

This lightweight version **removes big PDFs** and links the cards to images instead — so the zip is small and easy to upload to GitHub/Netlify.

## Deploy
1. Create a GitHub repo and upload everything from this zip.
2. In Netlify: Import from Git → choose the repo.
3. Build settings: **Build command:** (empty) • **Publish directory:** `.`
